## Motivation

Consider the following logistic mixed model with a spatial random effect
for spatially indexed binary data:

$$
\mathrm{logit}\{\mathrm{Pr}(Y_{ij} = 1 \mid x_{ij}, u(s_i))\} = x_{ij}^T\beta + u(s_i), \quad u(\cdot)\sim \text{ mean zero process}
$$

where $i=1,\dots,n$, $j=1,\dots,N_i$, $Y_{ij}$ is a binary response at
location $i$ and individual $j$, $x_{ij}$ is a vector of covariates,
$\beta$ is a vector of regression coefficients, and $u(s_i)$ is a
spatial random effect at location $s_i$. When $N_i=1$ for all $i$, this
reduces to point-referenced spatial binary data.

The random effect $u(\cdot)$, a mean zero stochastic process defined on
the whole spatial domain, accounts for spatial dependence and allows for
prediction at new location in a coherent probabilistic framework. The
most popular choice of $u(\cdot)$ is the Gaussian process.

However, by adding the random effect, the log-odds interpretation of
$\beta$ is changed from population-averaged to site-specific. In other
words, $\beta$ now represents the change in the log-odds of $Y$
associated with a 1-unit increase of $x$, holding the site fixed. This
is in contrast with population-averaged interpretation from the model
$\mathrm{logit}\{\mathrm{Pr}(Y_{ij} = 1 \mid x_{ij})\} = x_{ij}^T\beta^M$
(as usual interpretation in logistic regression without random effects),
where $\beta^M$ represents the change in the log-odds of $Y$ associated
with a 1-unit increase of $x$ without conditioning on the site. When
$u(\cdot)$ is a Gaussian process, the induced model for
$\mathrm{logit}\{\mathrm{Pr}(Y_{ij} = 1 \mid x_{ij})\}$ is no longer a
linear function of $x_{ij}$, and marginal interpretation of regression
coefficient is lost.

We develop a marginally interpretable spatial logistic model for
researchers who wish to **(1) have both population-averaged and
site-specific log-odds ratio interpretation of regression parameters,
(2) take account of spatial dependence, and (3) enable prediction of
probability of $Y$ at a new location, all in a single modeling
framework**. Extending the work of [Wang and Louis (2003)](#references),
we propose a novel stochastic process called bridge process for spatial
random effects based on normal scale mixture that allows marginal
interpretation of regression coefficients in spatial logistic
regression. Under a Bayesian framework, the inference is carried out
with highly efficient MCMC algorithm leveraging normal mixture
representation and Polya-Gamma data augmentation [(Polson et al.,
2013)](#references).

## Case study: Childhood malaria in the Gambia

We analyze childhood malaria prevalence data in the Gambia. It contains
$\sum_{i=1}^n N_i = 2035$ children’s malaria infection statuses from
$n=65$ villages, along with covariates including age, bed net use, net
treatment with insecticides, a satellite-derived measure of greenness,
and the presence of a health center in the villages. The study of
population-averaged associations between malaria prevalence and
covariates is useful for nationwide decision-making; for example, on
supplying bed nets. Prediction of malaria prevalence at new locations is
also of substantial interest.

### 1. Data preparation

We first load data from geoR package, and standardize the data following
[Gelman et al (2008)](#references).

``` r
library(spbridge)
data(gambia)
N = length(gambia$pos) # 2035
y = gambia$pos # binary response, N = 2035 by 1 vector
# define id based on spatial coords unique values
id = as.numeric(factor(paste(gambia$x, gambia$y))) 
n = length(unique(id)) # 65
coords = unique(cbind(gambia$x, gambia$y)/1000) # n by 2 matrix, in km

# standardized covariates following Gelman et al (2008)
intercept = rep(1,N) # intercept
age = scale(gambia$age/365, scale = 2*sd(gambia$age/365)) # in years
netuse = gambia$netuse - mean(gambia$netuse)
treated = gambia$treated - mean(gambia$treated)
green = scale(gambia$green, scale = 2*sd(gambia$green))
green2 = scale(gambia$green^2, scale = 2*sd(gambia$green^2))
healthctr = gambia$phc - mean(gambia$phc)

X = cbind(intercept, age, netuse, treated, green, green2, healthctr)
colnames(X) = c("(Intercept)", "age", "netuse", "treated", "green", "green2", "healthctr")

centers = c(attr(age, "scaled:center"), mean(gambia$netuse), mean(gambia$treated), 
            attr(green, "scaled:center"), attr(green2, "scaled:center"), mean(gambia$phc))
scales = c(attr(age, "scaled:scale"), 1, 1, attr(green, "scaled:scale"), attr(green2, "scaled:scale"), 1)
  
```

### 2. Fit the model

Now we fit the spatial logistic model with bridge process random effect
for inference of both $\beta^M$ and $\beta$, as well as Gaussian process
random effects for comparison of site-specific estimate $\beta$. We
closely followed the choice of prior suggested by [Gelman
(2006)](#references) and [Gelman et al (2008)](#references), e.g. Cauchy
prior for regression coefficients; see the manuscript for detailed
settings. Running times are less than 2 mins for 11,000 iteration under
Apple M1 CPU environment.

### 3. Summarize the result

Now we summarize the MCMC results after back-transforming the data in
the original scale. The conditional estimates are essentially identical.
From the proposed model, we also obtain parameters with
population-averaged interpretation as well that are comparable with
results of [Cattelan and Varin (2018)](#references). The trace plot
shows good convergence.
